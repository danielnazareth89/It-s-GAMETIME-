Instructions for Checking Submission and Using accumulo_script.sh

1) Ensure the update_script.sh given to the students to start up accumulo/hadoop/ZooKeeper in the VM HAS BEEN RUN ALREADY

2)Once verified that Accumulo,Zookeeper,Hadoop is running, run the accumulo script in this directory using command ./accumulo_script.sh

3) The script will use the csv files in directories East and West to check tweets and count win/lose. You can replace given data with your own correctly formatted csv files if desired.

4) Once script finishes running, you can scan tables result_east and result_west to view tweet counts for win and loss.These results have also been aggregated and summarised in the report submitted
To check result_east you must login as user east with password 123456 and for west username west and password 123456

5)The folder NBACount contains the Mapreduce WordCount jar used to check for win and lose words. It is run from within accumulo_script.sh itself and does not need to be touched.
